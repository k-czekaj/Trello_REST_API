# COLT 01/2023 project: Trello REST API testing with Postman

## :information_desk_person: About project

<p align="justify">COLT is a charitable 4-week collaborative testing project organised by <a href="http://cherry-it.pl/podsumowanie-colt-1-2023/" target="_blank">Cherry IT</a>. During the project, I had the opportunity to learn basic knowledge of the REST API, get to know the Postman tool, create my own collections based on Trello documentation, learn GIT and get to know GitHub. 

The result of the project is a collection of Trello REST API tests performed in the Postman tool.</p>
